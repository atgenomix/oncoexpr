\title{Trigger a Spark Query by Table Name Pattern}
\usage{
trigger_cluster_query_by_pattern(
  master,
  method,
  version,
  pattern,
  output_label = NULL,
  verbose = TRUE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{master}{Character. The Spark master connection string (e.g., "sc://localhost:7077").}

\item{method}{Character. The method used to connect to Spark (e.g., "spark_connect").}

\item{version}{Character. The Spark version (e.g., "2.4.3").}

\item{pattern}{Character. A regular expression used to filter table names, for example "^normcounts",
"^exacttest", or "^coldata".}

\item{output_label}{Character or NULL. An optional label used to name the returned result. If provided,
the function will return a named list. Default is \code{NULL}.}

\item{verbose}{Logical. If \code{TRUE}, prints detailed debugging messages. Default is \code{TRUE}.}
}
\value{
A promise that resolves to the query result. If \code{output_label} is provided, the result is
returned as a named list; otherwise, it is returned directly.
}
\description{
This function connects to a Spark database and retrieves data from a table that matches a specified
regular expression pattern. Instead of relying on a fixed table index, it filters table names using
the provided pattern, and if multiple tables match, selects the first one. It then executes a query
to retrieve all data from the matched table.
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
  # Retrieve data from a table whose name starts with "normcounts"
  normcount_future <- trigger_cluster_query_by_pattern(
    master = "sc://localhost:7077",
    method = "spark_connect",
    version = "2.4.3",
    pattern = "^normcounts",
    output_label = "init_tbl_normcount"
  )

  normcount_future \%...>\% (function(result) {
    print(result)
  })
}
